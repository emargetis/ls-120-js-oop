/*
1. Object oriented programming is a programming paradigm which organizes a 
program into objects as opposed to a procedural way of programming. Those 
objects encapsulate both state and behavior.

2. Advantages of OOP:
- easier to maintain (DONE RIGHT, OOP MAKES CODE FLEXIBLE, EASY TO UNDERSTAND,
AND EASY TO CHANGE)
- can work on some parts of code base without having to worry about downstream
effects to other parts of the code base (LESS DEPENDENCIES)
- more comprehensible and makes breaking down larger problems easier BECAUSE 
IT ALLOWS THEM TO THINK ABOUT A PROBLEM AT A HIGHER LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION

Disadvantages of OOP:
- larger programs (more lines of code AND FILES)
- programs can be less efficient (though not always) - MAY REQUURE MORE MEMORY,
DISK SPACE, AND COMPUTING POWER

3. Encapsulation is bundling RELATED state (properties) and functionality (methods) 
of an object together. It can also include access restrictions to state and
functionality through a public interface.

4. In JS encapsulation differs because there is not a proper way to enforce 
access restrictions, but there are imperfect ways to do it. 

In other languages, encapsulation concerns hiding details of an object from code
that uses the object. An object should only expose the methods and properties 
that other objects need to use the encapsulated object. However, JavaScript does 
not directly provide the means to limit exposure of methods and properties. 
There are ways to achieve a degree of access restriction, but they're not perfect.
